Is Kubernetes worth it?

## Is Kubernetes worth it?<br><br>

#### A dirty little secret in the cloud world is that container workloads have a higher total cost of ownership than they should.

I’ll go ahead and say it: When looking closer at the total cost of ownership (TCO) associated with Kubernetes, more
traditional development methods still have compelling advantages.

As we’re wrapping up another KubeCon, perhaps it is time to dig into this.

This is a rare position to take. I’ve used containers and Kubernetes since they first appeared on the cloud computing
scene many years ago. I’ve designed and built numerous scalable systems on public clouds using this technology, so I
know that it works, and it works well. My point is that it is often overapplied.

Systems builders are motivated by what the cool kids are doing these days rather than finding the solutions that return
the most business value.

As a result, I’m sure that millions of dollars are wasted as these architectural mistakes carry on. It’s time for us to
do better.
